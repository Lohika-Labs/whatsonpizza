# What's On Pizza Project

## Task

Build an ML model that would look at a picture of a pizza and output a list of possible pizza name.

So far, the model doesn't perform well, most likely due to a low-quality dataset.

We trained a model for a single-label classification, where the output just the name of the pizza.
